  <title>What does key strength mean?</title>

  <p>Whenever you pick a password, there are two factors to consider: the
  length of the password and how uncommon the password is. You try to satisfy
  these requirements by choosing a reasonably long password with a random mix
  of lower case and upper case alphabets, special characters, and numbers. This
  makes the generated password less easy to guess, and thus, more secure.</p>

  <p>The idea of key strength is similar. <app>Passwords and Keys</app>
  generates an uncommon and different number every single time you create a
  key, which you can think of as a secret password made by the key to keep
  your encrypted data safe. However, it is left to you to choose your key
  strength, which is the size of the generated random number. Key strength can
  be defined in terms of 1024, 1536 or 2048 bits.</p>

  <p>It is quite easy to see that higher the key strength, the more difficult
  and time consuming it is to guess the associated random number. You should
  choose your key strength in <app>Passwords and Keys</app> depending on how
  long you intend to use the key, that is, depending on how long you want the
  key to remain secure. Keys having a higher value of key strength remain
  secure for more number of years. In fact it would take an average computer
  more than 14 billion years to crack a key that is 2048 bits long.</p>

  <!-- stefw: I would suggest basing this page off the current
    reccomendations for key strength. The basic concepts for key
    strength, is that dependeng how long (in time, years) you want something to remain
    secure, you choose a given key length.
    
    This page might be a source for our recommendations in the help file:

    Note that in general in seahorse we ar etalking about the Assymetric key strength
    not the Symmetric ones.
