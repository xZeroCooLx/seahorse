    <desc>Create reasonably strong keys for short-term use and very strong keys
    for long-term use.</desc>

  <title>What does key strength mean?</title>

  <p>The strength of a key is determined by its length. <app>Passwords and
  Keys</app> generates a random set of characters every time you create a key.
  These random characters act as a secret cipher that the key uses to encrypt
  your data. The length of this generated random sequence determines how strong
  your key is. In general, the longer the sequence, stronger is the generated
  key.</p>

  <p>It is difficult and more time consuming to break a strong key, but
  stronger keys also slow down the encryption and signing process. You should
  choose your key strength in <app>Passwords and Keys</app> depending on how
  long you want to use the key. A small key is sufficient if you are going to
  be using it for a short period of time, but a larger key has better chances
  of remaining secure for a long period of time.</p>

  <note style="tip">
    <p>It would take the average computer more than 14 billion years to crack a
    key that is 2048 bits long, thus a 2048 bit key is usually sufficient for
    general usage.</p>

  <!-- stefw: I would suggest basing this page off the current
    reccomendations for key strength. The basic concepts for key
    strength, is that dependeng how long (in time, years) you want something to remain
    secure, you choose a given key length.

    This page might be a source for our recommendations in the help file:
    http://www.keylength.com/en/3/

    Note that in general in seahorse we ar etalking about the Assymetric key strength
    not the Symmetric ones.
